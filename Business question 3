Would you say the number of redirections is a strong indicator of whether or not the URL is phishing?
Why or why not? What metrics do you have to support your answer?

# Mean

      ## AVG()
      SELECT AVG(url_length), phishing from web_phishing group by phishing;
               avg         | phishing
      ---------------------+----------
       23.5899709644510712 |        0
       66.4911171002695121 |        1
# Mode

      ## COUNT()
      SELECT phishing, url_length AS mode_url_length, count
      FROM (SELECT COUNT(url_length) AS count, phishing, url_length from web_phishing
      group by url_length, phishing)
      group by phishing
      having count = max(count);

      ## MODE()
      SELECT phishing, MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY url_length) AS mode_url_length
      FROM web_phishing
      GROUP BY phishing;
